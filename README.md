Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The player will input their choice, and the computer will randomly choose one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors). The program will then determine the winner based on the classic rules.

Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries are required, but the random module is used to simulate the computer's choice.

How to Play
-The program will prompt you to input your choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
-The computer will randomly choose one of the three options.
-The game will then compare both choices and determine the winner:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock

The program will print the result, telling you whether you won, lost, or if it was a tie.

How to Run
1.Save the Python script as rock_paper_scissors.py.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using the following command:
python rock_paper_scissors.py
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

Example Output
Enter rock, paper, or scissors: rock
You chose rock and the computer chose scissors. You win!

Future Improvements
-Add input validation to ensure the player only enters valid choices (rock, paper, or scissors).
-Add an option to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.
-Add a score counter to keep track of wins and losses.
